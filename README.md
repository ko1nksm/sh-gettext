# sh-gettext

Fully portable gettext library for POSIX-compliant shell scripts.

## Introduction

sh-gettext is an easy to use and highly portable internationalization library for shell scripts. It supports all POSIX-compliant shells and can run in any environment. It is based on the gettext API and only commands `gettext` and `ngettext` are required. These API and commands will be standardized in POSIX.1-2023 (Issue 8). sh-gettext works with OS standard commands. If these commands are not installed, fallback to work with default messages.

This is an alternative library that aims to replace [GNU `gettext.sh`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/sh.html). It is currently in beta release. We will try to maintain the specifications as much as possible, but may change them in the future.

```

**NOTE:** If it cannot be translated, the message catalog may need to be reworked.

```sh
msgfmt -o locale/ja/LC_MESSAGES/sh-gettext-example.mo po/ja.po
```

## Requirements

- **POSIX shell**
  - dash, bash, ksh, zsh, etc
- **`gettext` and `ngettext` commands**
  - These commands are standardized in POSIX issue 8
  - If not installed, fall back to the implementation without translation
- `msgfmt` command (Recommendation)
- `xgettext` with shell script support (Development)

`gettext`, `ngettext`, `msgfmt`, and `xgettext` are standardized in POSIX.1-2023 (Issue 8).

Shells that we have decided not to support due to shell bugs:

- pdksh (v5.2.14 99/07/13.2), posh (0.14.1)
  - bug: `set -- abc a; echo ${1#"$2"}` => falsely empty
- ksh88 (Version M-11/16/88), ksh93 (Version JM 93t+ 2009-05-01)
  - bug: "@: parameter not set" (It works if you don't `set -u`)
- bash (2.04)
  - bug: Segmentation fault

### MSGID

MSGID is the key used for translation. For example, `_ "Hello World"`, `_ 'Hello World'`, `_ $'Hello World'` would be the MSGID of the message `Hello World`. If no translation is found, the MSGID is output as is.

It is not possible to include variables or command substitutions in the MSGID. To be precise, the translation itself works, but `xgettext`, which generates the message catalog, does not recognize it as a string to be translated.

```sh
# Wrong MSGIDs
_ "Hello${TAB}World"
_ "Hello$(printf '\t')World"
```

`$'...'` is a shell feature called "Dollar-Single-Quotes" that will be standardized in POSIX Issue 8. When newlines or tabs are included in A `$'...'`, it can be written with escape sequences like `$'FOO\tBAR\n'`.

Dollar-Single-Quotes is a feature that is already available in many shells, such as bash, but not yet in dash. However, sh-gettext implements a workaround so that Dollar-Single-Quotes can be used in shells that do not support Dollar-Single-Quotes as far as MSGID is concerned (The feature does not make Dollar-Single-Quote available to the entire shell script). If Dollar-Single-Quotes is not used, it could be written as follows, but it would be difficult to read.

```sh
_ 'Hello	World' # It contains a tab character
_ 'Hello
World' # It contains a newline character

_ $'Hello\tWorld\n' # Legible
```

#### Dollar-Single-Quotes Limitations

sh-gettext has the unique feature of being able to use Dollar-Single-Quotes with MSGID, which is useful for including tabs and newlines in messages. However, the following Limitations are made so that shells that support Dollar-Single-Quotes and shells that do not support Dollar-Single-Quotes can be written in the same way.

**If the first character of the MSGID is `$`, it cannot be written as `'MSGID'` or `"MSGID"`.** If the first character is `$`, you must write `$'$ is dollar'`. This is because shells that do not support dollar-single quoting use the leading `$` to determine whether to interpret backslash escape sequences.

```sh
#  Shells that do not support $'...' cannot distinguish between
_ '$ is dollar'
_ $'is dollar'

# It should be written as follows
_ $'$ is dollar'
```

**Cannot split a string into multiple quotes.** The entire message must be written in a single Dollar-Single-Quote. This is because the decision to interpret backslash escape sequences is made only at the beginning of the string.

```sh
# The entire message must be written in one $'...'
_ $'Hello world\n'    # Correct
_ $'Hello '$'world\n' # Wrong
_ $'Hello ''world\n'  # Wrong
```

**If you want to include single quotes in a string, you cannot use `\'`.** You must use `\47` or `\047` instead.

```sh
# Wrong
_ $'It\'s a small world\n'

# Correct
_ $'It\47s a small world\n'
_ $'It\047s a small world\n'
```

Despite this limitation, we believe it is more convenient to make Dollar-Single-Quote available because messages often contain tabs and newlines.

### shgettext_print ( _ )

```txt
_ MSGID [-n | --] [ARGUMENT]...
shgettext_print MSGID [-n | --] [ARGUMENT]...
```

In many other programming languages, `_` is an alias for the `gettext` function, but in sh-gettext it is an alias for the `shgettext_print` shell function. The `shgettext_print` shell function performs variable expansion, similar to the `eval_gettext` shell function in `gettext.sh`.

The second argument is a flag, specify `-n` or `--`. If `-n` is specified, suppresses output of trailing a newline. If `--` is specified, a newline is output. `--` is optional, but we recommend not omitting it given the possibility that the value of ARGUMENT is `--`.

If the MSGID contains the `%` format, the arguments are expanded and the value passed in ARGUMENT is assigned. See `shgettext_printf` for about format.

### shgettext_nprint ( n_ )

```txt
n_ MSGID MSGID-PLURAL [-n | --] N [ARGUMENT]...
shgettext_nprint MSGID MSGID-PLURAL [-n | --] N [ARGUMENT]...
```

Use `n_` to internationalize messages for plurals. It is an alias for the `shgettext_nprint` shell function. The `shgettext_nprint` shell function performs variable expansion, similar to the `eval_ngettext` shell function in `gettext.sh`.

The third argument is a flag, specify `-n` or `--`. If `-n` is specified, suppresses output of trailing a newline. If `--` is specified, a newline is output. `--` is optional. Since the next argument is numeric, `--` can safely be omitted.

If the fourth argument is `1`, MSGID is used as the message; if it is not `1`, MSGID-PLURAL is used.

If the MSGID contains the `%` format, the arguments are expanded and the value passed in ARGUMENT is assigned. See `shgettext_printf` for about format.

### shgettext_gettext

```txt
shgettext_gettext MSGID
```

Equivalent to `gettext -E`. Options are not available and escape sequences are not interpreted.

### shgettext_ngettext

```txt
shgettext_ngettext MSGID MSGID-PLURAL N
```

Equivalent to `ngettext -E`. Options are not available and escape sequences are not interpreted.

### shgettext_printf

```txt
shgettext_printf FORMAT [ARGUMENT]...
```

The values passed in ARGUMENT is expanded according to FORMAT. It internally executes the `printf` command and basically interprets the same format as the `printf` command, but with the following differences.

- Do not interpret backslash escape sequences (only % format is interpreted)
- Supports positional variable references with the format `<number>$`
- Support for output grouping numbers by the `'` flag (e.g. `%'d`)
  - If the `printf` implementation does not support the `'` flag, it is ignored
- Arguments remaining after FORMAT consumes arguments are ignored
- If the argument referenced by FORMAT does not exist, the format remains in place

### shgettext_printfln

```txt
shgettext_printfln FORMAT [ARGUMENT]...
```

Same as `shgettext_printf` except for the addition of a newline at the end of the output.

### shgettext_echo

```txt
shgettext_echo STRING
```

This function is provided as a transition from `gettext.sh`. Those who don't need it don't need to use it. It has the same functionality as the function set in `the $echo` variable of `gettext.sh`, outputting the first argument and newline and not interpreting backslash escape sequences.

If you want, you can have it do the equivalent of `$echo` by doing the following

```txt
echo='shgettext_echo'
$echo foo
```

For more information on `$echo`, see [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/gettext_002esh.html).

### shgettext_detect_decimal_point

```txt
shgettext_detect_decimal_point STRING
```

Re-detect locale-dependent decimal point symbols.

## Environment Variables

### SHGETTEXT_GETTEXT, SHGETTEXT_NGETTEXT

Set this environment variable if you want to use different implementations of `gettext` and `ngettext`. It must be set before loading `sh-gettext.sh`.

```sh
if type ggettext >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  SHGETTEXT_GETTEXT=ggettext
fi

. sh-gettext.sh
```

### SHGETTEXT_PRINTF

Set this environment variable if you want to use different implementations of `printf`. It must be set before loading `sh-gettext.sh`.

```sh
SHGETTEXT_PRINTF=/usr/bin/printf

. sh-gettext.sh
```

## Notes on using the xgettext command

To create a message catalog, see [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/index.html).

Since the messages to be translated are defined by keywords that differ from the standard, an option to add the keywords must be specified.

```sh
# To add only _ and n_ as keywords
xgettext -k_:1 -kn_:1,2 example.sh

# To add all functions as keywords
xgettext -k_:1 -kn_:1,2 -kshgettext_gettext:1 -kshgettext_ngettext:1,2 example.sh

# In POSIX, -K option is standardized instead of -k option.
# (I don't know of any implementation that can use the -K option)
xgettext -K _:1 -K n_:1,2 example.sh
xgettext -K _:1 -K n_:1,2 -K shgettext_gettext:1 -K shgettext_ngettext:1,2 example.sh
```
